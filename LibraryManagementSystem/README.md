# 📚 Library Management System (Java Console App)

This is a **console-based Library Management System** written in Java.  
It represents a **simplified and incomplete version** of a university assignment, built primarily for practice purposes.

> ⚠️ Note: This project is **not fully implemented**.  
> It contains basic class structures and partial logic but is **not a complete functional system**.  
> It served as a personal exercise before starting a full-stack project.
